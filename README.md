# Loopon-Factorial-Challenge

This algorith uses infinite precision arithmetics to calculate the factorial of
virtually any number, as long as you don't overflow your computer's memory.

It is currently configured to a maximum input of 4 digits and a maximum output
of 36000 digits. To tweak these values, check the IN_LEN and OUT_LEN 
definitions on the top of the main.c file.
